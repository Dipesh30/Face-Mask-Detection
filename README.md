## Introduction

With the rise of health concerns, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective monitoring of mask usage has become crucial. This project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately classify images of individuals as either wearing a mask or not wearing a mask.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images categorized into two classes: "with mask" and "without mask." You can find the dataset in the `data/images` directory, or you can use publicly available datasets such as:

- [Kaggle Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/face-mask-detection)

Ensure to preprocess the dataset for optimal model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- [Any other libraries or tools you used]

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Key components include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce the spatial dimensions.
- **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.

You can find the model architecture details in `src/model.py`.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:Dipesh30/Face-Mask-Detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd face-mask-detection
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset and place the images in the data/images directory.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Usage
After training the model, you can use it to detect masks in new images or in real-time video feeds. To test the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
For real-time detection from a webcam, simply run:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --video
